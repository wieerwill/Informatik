    \subsection{Vulnerability Analysis}
    Identification of technical, organizational, human vulnerabilities of IT systems.

    \note{Vulnerability}{Feature of hardware and software constituting, an organization running, or a human operating an IT system, which is a necessary precondition for any attack in that system, with the goal to compromise one of its security properties. Set of all vulnerabilities = a systemâ€™s attack surface.}

    \subsubsection{Human Vulnerabilities}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Laziness
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Passwords on Post-It
            \item Fast-clicking exercise: Windows UAC pop-up boxes
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Social Engineering
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Pressure from your boss
            \item A favor for your friend
            \item Blackmailing: The poisoned daughter, \dots
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Lack of knowledge
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Importing and executing malware
            \item Indirect, hidden information flowin access control systems
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Limited knowledge/skills of users
    \end{itemize*}

    \note{Social Engineering}{Influencing people into acting against their own interest or the interest of an organisation is often a simpler solution than resorting to malware or hacking.
        %Both law enforcement and the financial industry indicate that social engineering continues to enable attackers who lack the technical skills, motivation to use them or the resources to purchase or hire them. Additionally, targeted social engineering allows those technically gifted to orchestrate blended attacks bypassing both human and hardware or software lines of defence.
    }

    \subsubsection{Indirect Information Flow in Access Control Systems}

    \note{Security Requirement}{No internal information about a project, which is not approved, should ever go public}

    \note{Forbidden Information Flow}{Internal information goes into unwanted publicity}

    Problem Analysis
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Problem complexity $\rightarrow$ effects of individual permission assignments by users to system-wide security properties
        \item Limited configuration options and granularity: archaic and inapt security mechanisms in system and application software
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item no isolation of non-trusted software
            \item no enforcement of global security policies
        \end{itemize*}
        \item[$\rightarrow$] Effectiveness of discretionary access control (DAC)
    \end{itemize*}

    \subsubsection{Organizational Vulnerabilities}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Access to rooms (servers)
        \item Assignment of permission on organizational level, e. g.
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item 4-eyes principle
            \item need-to-know principle
            \item definition of roles and hierarchies
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Management of cryptographic keys
    \end{itemize*}

    \subsubsection{Technical Vulnerabilities}
    The Problem: Complexity of IT Systems
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item \dots  will in foreseeable time not be
        \item Completely, consistently, unambiguously, correctly specified $\rightarrow$ contain specification errors
        \item Correctly implemented $\rightarrow$ contain programming errors
        \item Re-designed on a daily basis $\rightarrow$ contain conceptual weaknesses and vulnerabilities
        \item Weak security paradigms
    \end{itemize*}

    \subsection{Threat Analysis}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Identification of Attack objectives and attackers
        \item Identification of Attack methods and practices (Techniques)
        \item[$\rightarrow$] know your enemy
    \end{itemize*}

    Approach: Compilation of a threat catalog, content:
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item identified attack objectives
        \item identified potential attackers
        \item identified attack methods \& techniques
        \item damage potential of attacks
    \end{itemize*}

    \subsubsection{Attack Objectives and Attackers}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Economic Espionage and political power
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Victims: high tech industry
            \item Attackers:
            \begin{itemize*}
                \item Competitors, governments, professional organizations
                \item Insiders
                \item regular, often privileged users of IT systems
            \end{itemize*}
            \item often indirect $\rightarrow$ social engineering
            \item statistical profile: age 30-40, executive function
            \item weapons: technical and organisational insider knowledge
            \item damage potential: Loss of control over critical knowledge $\rightarrow$ loss of economical or political power
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Personal Profit
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Objective: becoming rich(er)
            \item Attackers: Competitors, Insiders
            \item damage potential: Economical damage (loss of profit)
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Wreak Havoc
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Objective: damaging or destroying things or lives, blackmailing,\dots
            \item Attackers:
            \begin{itemize*}
                \item Terrorists: motivated by faith and philosophy, paid by organisations and governments
                \item Avengers: see insiders
                \item Psychos: all ages, all types, personality disorder
                \item[$\rightarrow$] No regular access to IT systems, no insider knowledge, but skills and tools.
            \end{itemize*}
            \item damage potential: Loss of critical infrastructures
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Meet a challenge (Hackers both good or evil)
    \end{itemize*}

    \subsubsection{Attack Methods}
    \paragraph{Scenario 1: Insider Attack}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Social Engineering
        \item Exploitation of conceptual vulnerabilities (DAC)
        \item Professionally tailored malware
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{Scenario 2: Malware (a family heirloom \dots )}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Trojan horses: Executable code with hidden functionality
        \item Viruses: Code for self-modification and self-duplication
        \item Logical bombs: Code that is activated by some event recognizable from the host (e. g. time, date, temperature, \dots ).
        \item Backdoors: Code that is activated through undocumented interfaces (mostly remote).
        \item Ransomware: Code for encrypting possibly all user data found on the host, used for blackmailing the victims
        \item Worms: Autonomous, self-duplicating programs
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{Scenario 3: Outsider Attack}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Attack Method: Buffer Overflow
        \item Exploitation of implementation errors
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{Scenario 4: High-end Malware (Root Kits)}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Invisible, total, sustainable takeover of a complete IT system
        \item Method: Comprehensive tool kit for fully automated attacks
        \begin{enumerate*}
            \item automatic analysis of technical vulnerabilities
            \item automated attack execution
            \item automated installation of backdoors
            \item installation and activation of stealth mechanisms
        \end{enumerate*}
        \item Target: Attacks on all levels of the software stack:
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item firmware \& bootloader
            \item operating system (e. g. file system, network interface)
            \item system applications (e. g. file and process managers)
            \item user applications (e. g. web servers, email, office)
        \end{itemize*}
        \item tailored to specific software and software versions found there
    \end{itemize*}

    \subsubsection{Buffer Overflow Attacks}
    Privileged software can be tricked into executing attackerâ€™s code.
    Approach: Cleverly forged parameters overwrite procedure activation frames in memory $\rightarrow$ exploitation of missing length checks on input buffers $\rightarrow$ buffer overflow

    What an Attacker Needs to Know
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Source code of the target program, obtained by disassembling
        \item Better symbol table, as with an executable
        \item Better most precise knowledge about the compiler used (Stack)
    \end{itemize*}
    Sketch of the Attack Approach (Observations during program execution)
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Stack grows towards the small addresses
        \item in each procedure frame: address of the next instruction to call after the current procedure returns (ReturnIP)
        \item after storing the ReturnIP, compilers reserve stack space for local variables $\rightarrow$ these occupy lower addresses
    \end{itemize*}
    Result
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Attacker makes victim program overwrite runtime-critical parts of its stack
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item by counting up to the length of msg
            \item at the same time writing back over previously save runtime information $\rightarrow$ ReturnIP
        \end{itemize*}
        \item After finish: victim program executes code at address of ReturnIP (=address of a forged call to execute arbitrary programs)
        \item Additional parameter: file system location of a shell
    \end{itemize*}

    \note{Security Breach}{The attacker can remotely communicate, upload, download, and execute anything- with cooperation of the OS, since all of this runs with the original privileges of the victim program!}

    \subsubsection{Root Kits}
    Step 1: Vulnerability Analysis
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Tools look for vulnerabilities in
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Active privileged services and demons
            \item Configuration files $\rightarrow$ Discover weak passwords, open ports
            \item Operating systems $\rightarrow$ Discover kernel and system tool versions with known implementation errors
        \end{itemize*}
        \item built-in knowledge base: automatable vulnerability database
        \item Result: System-specific collection of vulnerabilities $\rightarrow$ choice of attack method and tools to execute
    \end{itemize*}
    Step 2: Attack Execution
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Fabrication of tailored software to exploit vulnerabilities in
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Server processes or system tool processes (demons)
            \item OS kernel to execute code of attacker with root privileges
        \end{itemize*}
        \item This code
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item First installs smoke-bombs for obscuring attack
            \item replaces original system software by pre-fabricated modules
            \item containing backdoors or smoke bombs for future attacks
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Backdoors allow for high-privilege access in short time
        \item System modified with attackerâ€™s servers, demons, utilities\dots
        \item Obfuscation of modifications and future access
    \end{itemize*}
    Step 3: Attack Sustainability
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Backdoors for any further control \& command in Servers, \dots
        \item Modifications of utilities and OS to prevent
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Killing root kit processes and connections (kill,signal)
            \item Removal of root kit files (rm,unlink)
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Results: Unnoticed access for attacker anytime, highly privileged, extremely fast, virtually unpreventable
    \end{itemize*}
    Step 4: Stealth Mechanisms (Smoke Bombs)
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Clean logfiles (entries for root kit processes, network connections)
        \item Modify system admin utilities
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Process management (hide running root kit processes)
            \item File system (hide root kit files)
            \item Network (hide active root kit connections)
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Substitute OS kernel modules and drivers (hide root kit processes, files, network connections), e.g. /proc/\dots , stat, fstat, pstat
        \item Processes, files and communication of root kit become invisible
    \end{itemize*}

    Risk and Damage Potential:
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Likeliness of success: extremely highin todayâ€™s commodity OSs (High number of vulnerabilities, Speed, Fully automated)
        \item Fighting the dark arts: extremely difficult (Number and cause of vulnerabilities, weak security mechanisms, Speed, Smoke bombs)
        \item Prospects for recovering the system after successful attack $\sim 0$
    \end{itemize*}

    Countermeasure options
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Reactive: even your OS might have become your enemy
        \item Preventive: Counter with same tools for vulnerability analysis
        \item Preventive: Write correct software
    \end{itemize*}

    \note{Security Engineering}{
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item New paradigms: policy-controlled systems $\rightarrow$ powerful software platforms
            \item New provable guarantees: formal security models $\rightarrow$ reducing specification errors and faults by design
            \item New security architectures $\rightarrow$ limiting bad effects of implementation errors and faults
        \end{itemize*}
    }

    \subsection{Risk Analysis}
    Identification and Classification of scenario-specific risks
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Risks $\subseteq$ Vulnerabilities $\times$ Threats
        \item Correlation of vulnerabilities and threats $\rightarrow$ Risk catalogue
        \item n Vulnerabilities, m Threats $\rightarrow$ x Risks
        \item $max(n,m)<< x \leq nm$ $\rightarrow$ quite large risk catalogue
        \item Classification of risks $\rightarrow$ Complexity reduction $\rightarrow$ Risk matrix
    \end{itemize*}

    Damage Potential Assessment
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Cloud computing $\rightarrow$ loss of confidence/reputation
        \item Industrial plant control $\rightarrow$ damage or destruction of facility
        \item Critical public infrastructure $\rightarrow$ impact on public safety
        \item Traffic management $\rightarrow$ maximum credible accident
    \end{itemize*}

    Occurrence Probability Assessment
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Cloud computing $\rightarrow$ depending on client data sensitivity
        \item Industrial plant control $\rightarrow$ depending on plant sensitivity
        \item Critical public infrastructure $\rightarrow$ depending on terroristic threat
        \item Traffic management $\rightarrow$ depending on terroristic threat level
    \end{itemize*}

    \note{Damage potential \& Occurrence probability}{is scenario-specific}

    Depends on diverse, mostly non-technical side conditions $\rightarrow$ advisory board needed for assessment

    Security Policies: a preliminary Definition
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Malware attack $\rightarrow$ violation of confidentiality and integrity
        \item infer security requirements: Valid information flows
        \item design a security policy: Rules for controlling information flows
    \end{itemize*}

    \note{Security Policy}{a set of rules designed to meet a set of security objectives}

    \note{Security Objective}{a statement of intent to counter a given threat or to enforce a given security policy}

    Policy representations:
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item informal (natural language) text

    \subsection{Security Models}
    Complete, unambiguous representation of security policies for
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item analyzing and explaining its behavior
        \item enabling its correct implementation
    \end{itemize*}

    How We Use Formal Models: Model-based Methodology
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Abstraction from (too complex) reality $\rightarrow$ get rid of details
        \item Precision in describing what is significant $\rightarrow$ Model analysis and implementation
    \end{itemize*}

    \note{Security Model}{A security model is a precise, generally formal representation of a security policy.}

    Model Spectrum
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Models for access control policies:
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item identity-based access control (IBAC)
            \item role-based access control (RBAC)
            \item attribute-based access control (ABAC)
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Models for information flow policies $\rightarrow$ multilevel security (MLS)
        \item Models for non-interference/domain isolation policies $\rightarrow$ non-interference (NI)
        \item In Practice: Most often hybrid models
    \end{itemize*}

    \subsubsection{Access Control Models}
    Formal representations of permissions to execute operations on objects

    Security policies describe access rules $\rightarrow$ security models formalize them

    \note{Identity-based access control models (IBAC)}{Rules based on the identity of individual subjects (users, processes, \dots ) or objects (files, \dots)}

    \note{Role-based access control models (RBAC)}{Rules based on roles of subjects in an organization}

    \note{Attribute-based access control models (ABAC)}{Rules based on attributes of subjects and objects}

    \note{Discretionary Access Control (DAC)}{Individual users specify access rules to objects within their area of responsibility (at their discretion).}
    Consequence: Individual users
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item granting access permissions as individually needed
        \item need to collectively enforce their organizationâ€™s security policy
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item competency problem
            \item responsibility problem
            \item malware problem
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    \note{Mandatory Access Control (MAC)}{System designers and administrators specify system-wide rules, that apply for all users and cannot be sidestepped.}
    Consequence:
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Limited individual freedom
        \item Enforced by central instance:
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item clearly identified
            \item competent (security experts)
            \item responsible (organizationally \& legally)
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{DAC vs. MAC}
    In Real-world Scenarios: Mostly hybrid models enforced by both discretionary and mandatory components
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item \textbf{DAC} locally within a project, team members individually define permissions w. r. t. documents inside this closed scope
        \item \textbf{MAC} globally for the organization, such that e. g. only documents approved for release by organizational policy rules may be accessed from outside a projectâ€™s scope
    \end{itemize*}

    \subsubsection{Identity-based Access Control Models (IBAC)}
    To precisely specify the rights of individual, acting entities.
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{Assets/Systemsicherheit-ibac-basic.png}
    \end{center}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item \textbf{Subjects}, i.e. active and identifiable entities, that execute
        \item \textbf{Operations} on
        \item passive and identifiable \textbf{Objects}, requiring
        \item \textbf{Rights} (also: permissions, privileges) which
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item control (restrict) execution of operations,
            \item are checked against identity of subjects and objects.
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    Access Control Functions [Lampson, 1974]
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item basic model to define access rights: Who (subject) is allowed to do what (operation) on which object
        \item Access Control Function (ACF)
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item $f:S \times O \times OP \rightarrow \{true,false\}$ where
            \item $S$ is a set of subjects (e.g. users, processes),
            \item $O$ is a set of objects (e.g. files, sockets),
            \item $OP$ is a finite set of operations (e.g. read, write, delete)
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Interpretation: Rights to execute operations are modeled by ACF
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item any $s\in S$ represents an authenticated active entity which potentially executes operations on objects
            \item any $o\in O$ represents an authenticated passive entity on which operations are executed
            \item for any $s\in S$,$o\in O$,$op\in OP$: s is allowed to execute $op$ on $o$ iff $f(s,o,op)=true$.
            \item Model making: finding a $tuple\langle S,O,OP,f\rangle$
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{Access Control Matrix}
    Lampson addresses how to \dots
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item store in a well-structured way,
        \item efficiently evaluate and
        \item completely analyze an ACF
    \end{itemize*}

    \note{Access Control Matrix (ACM)}{An ACM is a matrix $m:S\times O \rightarrow 2^{OP}$, such that $\forall s\in S,\forall o\in O:op\in m(s,o)\Leftrightarrow f(s,o,op)$.}

    An ACM is a rewriting of the definition of an ACF: nothing is added, nothing is left out (,,$\Leftrightarrow$'').
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item $S=\{s_1 ,\dots ,s_n\}$
        \item $O=\{o_1 ,\dots ,o_k\}$
        \item $OP=\{read,write\}$
        \item $2^{OP}=\{\varnothing,\{read\},\{write\},\{read,write\}\}^2$
        %\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Assets/Systemsicherheit-access-control-matrix.png}
    \end{itemize*}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item ACMs are implemented in most OS, DB, Middlewear
        \item whose security mechanisms use one of two implementations
    \end{itemize*}

    Access Control Lists (ACLs)
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Columns of the ACM: $char*o3[N]=\{ '-', '-', 'rw', \dots \};$
        \item Found in I-Nodes of Unix, Windows, Mac OS
    \end{itemize*}

    Capability Lists
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Rows of the ACM: $char* s1[K]=\{'-', 'r', '-', \dots \};$
        \item Found in distributed OSs, middleware, Kerberos
    \end{itemize*}

    \note{Protection State}{A fixed-time snapshot of all active entities, passive entities, and any meta-information used for making access decisions is called the protection state of an access control system.}

    ACF/ACM are to precisely specify a protection state of an AC system

    \paragraph{The Harrison-Ruzzo-Ullman Model (HRU)}

    Privilege escalation question: ,,Can it ever happen that in a given state, some specific subject obtains a specific permission?'' $\varnothing \Rightarrow \{r,w\}$
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item ACM models a single state $\langle S,O,OP,m\rangle$
        \item ACM does not tell anything about what might happen in future
        \item Behavior prediction $\rightarrow$ proliferation of rights $\rightarrow$ HRU safety
    \end{itemize*}

    We need a model which allows statements about
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Dynamic behavior of right assignments
        \item Complexity of such an analysis
    \end{itemize*}

    Idea [Harrison et al., 1976]: A (more complex) security model combining
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Lampsonâ€™s ACM $\rightarrow$ for modeling single protection state of an AC
        \item Deterministic automata $\rightarrow$ for modeling runtime changes of a protection state
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{Deterministic Mealy Automata}
    $(Q,\sum,\Omega,\delta,\lambda,q_0)$
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item $Q$ is a finite set of states, e. g. $Q=\{q_0 ,q_1 ,q_2\}$
        \item $\sum$ is a finite set of input words, e. g. $\sum=\{a,b\}$
        \item $\Omega$ is a finite set of output words, e. g. $\Omega=\{yes,no\}$
        \item $\delta:Q\times\sum\rightarrow Q$ is the state transition function
        \item $\lambda:Q\times\sum\rightarrow\Omega$ is the output function
        \item $q_0\in Q$ is the initial state
        \item $\delta(q,\sigma)=q'$ and $\lambda(q,\sigma)=\omega$ can be expressed through the state diagram
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{HRU Security Model}
    How we use Deterministic Automata
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Snapshot of an ACM is the automatonâ€™s state
        \item Changes of the ACM during system usage are modeled by state transitions of the automaton
        \item Effects of operations that cause such transitions are described by the state transition function
        \item Analyses of right proliferation ($\rightarrow$ privilege escalation) are enabled by state reachability analysis methods
    \end{itemize*}

    An HRU model is a deterministic automaton $\langle Q,\sum,\delta,q_0 ,R\rangle$ where
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item $Q= 2^S\times 2^O\times M$ is the state space where
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item S is a (not necessarily finite) set of subjects,
            \item O is a (not necessarily finite) set of objects,
            \item $M=\{m|m:S\times O\rightarrow 2^R\}$ is a set of possible ACMs,
        \end{itemize*}
        \item $\sum=OP\times X$ is the (finite) input alphabet where
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item $OP$ is a set of operations,
            \item $X=(S\cup O)^k$ is a set of k-dimensional vectors of arguments (subjects or objects) of these operations,
        \end{itemize*}
        \item $\sigma:Q\times\sum\rightarrow Q$ is the state transition function,
        \item $q_0\in Q$ is the initial state,
        \item R is a (finite) set of access rights.
        \item Each $q=S_q,O_q,m_q\in Q$ models a systemâ€™s protection state:
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item current subjects set $S_q\subseteq S$
            \item current objects set $O_q\subseteq O$
            \item current ACM $m_q\in M$ where $m_q:S_q\times O_q\rightarrow 2^R$
        \end{itemize*}
        \item State transitions modeled by $\delta$ based on
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item the current automaton state
            \item an input word $\langle op,(x_1,\dots ,x_k)\rangle \in\sum$ where $op$
            \item may modify $S_q$ (create a user $x_i$),
            \item may modify $O_q$ (create/delete a file $x_i$),
            \item may modify the contents of a matrix cell $m_q(x_i,x_j)$ (enter or remove rights) where $1\leq i,j\leq k$.
            \item[$\rightarrow$] We also call $\delta$ the state transition scheme (STS) of a model
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{State Transition Scheme (STS)}
    Using the STS, $\sigma:Q\times\sum\rightarrow Q$ is defined by a set of specifications in the normalized form
    $\sigma(q,\langle op,(x_1,\dots ,x_k)\rangle )$=if $r_1\in m_q(x_{s1},x_{o1}) \wedge \dots  \wedge r_m\in m_q(x_{sm},x_{om})$ then $p_1\circ \dots \circ p_n$ where
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item $q=\{S_q,O_q,m_q\}\in Q,op\in OP$
        \item $r_1 \dots r_m\in R$
        \item $x_{s1},\dots ,x_{sm}\in S_q$ and $x_{o1},\dots ,x_{om}\in O_q$ where $s_i$ and $o_i$, $1\leq i\leq m$, are vector indices of the input arguments: $1\leq s_i,o_i\leq k$
        \item $p_1,\dots ,p_n$ are HRU primitives
        \item $\circ$ is the function composition operator: $(f\circ g)(x)=g(f(x))$
    \end{itemize*}

    Conditions: Expressions that need to evaluate ,,true'' for state q as a necessary precondition for command $op$ to be executable (= can be successfully called).

    Primitives: Short, formal macros that describe differences between $q$ and $a$ successor state $q'=\sigma(q,\langle op,(x_1 ,\dots ,x_k)\rangle )$ that result from a complete execution of op:
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item enter r into $m(x_s,x_o)$
        \item delete r from $m(x_s,x_o)$
        \item create subject $x_s$
        \item create object $x_o$
        \item destroy subject $x_s$
        \item destroy object $x_o$
        \item Each above with semantics for manipulating $S_q, O_q$ or $m_q$.
    \end{itemize*}

    Note the atomic semantics: the HRU model assumes that each command successfully called is always completely executed!

    How to Design an HRU Security Model:
    \begin{enumerate*}
        \item Model Sets: Subjects, objects, operations, rights $\rightarrow$ define the basic sets $S,O,OP,R$
        \item STS: Semantics of operations (e. g. the future API of the system to model) that modify the protection state $\rightarrow$ define $\sigma$ using the normalized form/programming syntax of the STS
        \item Initialization: Define a well-known initial stateq $0 =\langle S_0 ,O_0 ,m_0 \rangle$ of the system to model
    \end{enumerate*}

    Summary: Model Behavior
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item The modelâ€™s input is a sequence of actions from OP together with their respective arguments.
        \item The automaton changes its state according to the STS and the semantics of HRU primitives.
        \item In the initial state, each subject may (repeatedly) use a right on an object
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{HRU Model Analysis}
    Analysis of Right Proliferation
    \note{HRU Safety}{(also simple-safety) A state q of an HRU model is called HRU safe with respect to a right $r\in R$ iff, beginning with q, there is no sequence of commands that enters r in an ACM cell where it did not exist in q.}

    \note{Transitive State Transition Function $\delta^*$:}{Let $\sigma\sigma\in\sum^*$ be a sequence of inputs consisting of a single input $\sigma\in\sum\cup\{\epsilon\}$ followed by a sequence $\sigma\in\sum^*$, where $\epsilon$ denotes an empty input sequence. Then, $\delta^*:Q\times\sum^*\rightarrow Q$ is defined by
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item $\delta^*(q,\sigma\sigma^*)=\delta^*(\delta(q,\sigma),\sigma^*)$
            \item $\delta^*(q,\epsilon)=q$.
        \end{itemize*}
    }

    According to Tripunitara and Li, simple-safety is defined as:
    \note{HRU Safety}{For a state $q=\{S_q,O_q,m_q\}\in Q$ and a right $r\in R$ of an HRU model $\langle Q,\sum,\delta,q_0,R\rangle$, the predicate $safe(q,r)$ holds iff
    $\forall q'= S_{q'},O_{q'},m_{q'} \in \{\delta^*(q,\sigma^*)|\sigma^*\in\sum^*\},\forall s\in S_{q'},\forall o\in O_{q'}: r\in m_{q'}(s,o)\Rightarrow s\in S_q \wedge o\in O_q \wedge r\in m_q(s,o)$.
    We say that an HRU model is safe w.r.t. r iff $safe(q_0 ,r)$.}

    showing that an HRU model is safe w.r.t. r means to
    \begin{enumerate*}
        \item Search for any possible (reachable) successor state $q'$ of $q_0$
        \item Visit all cells in $m_{q'}$ ($\forall s\in S_{q'},\forall o\in O_{q'}:\dots $)
        \item If r is found in one of these cells ($r\in m_{q'}(s,o)$), check if
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item $m_q$ is defined for this very cell ($s\in S_q\wedge o\in O_q$),
            \item $r$ was already contained in this very cell in $m_q$ ($r\in m_q\dots $).
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Recursiv. proceed with 2. for any possible successor state $q''$ of $q'$
    \end{enumerate*}

    \note{Theorem 1 [Harrison]}{Ingeneral, HRU safety is not decidable.}

    \note{Theorem 2 [Harrison]}{For mono-operational models, HRU safety is decidable.}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Insights into the operational principles modeled by HRU models
        \item Demonstrates a method to prove safety property for a particular, given model
        \item[$\rightarrow$] ,,Proofs teach us how to build things so nothing more needs to be proven.'' (W. E. KÃ¼hnhauser)
    \end{itemize*}

    a mono-operational HRU model $\rightarrow$ exactly one primitive for each operation in the STS

    \paragraph{Proof of Theorem - Proof Sketch}
    \begin{enumerate*}
        \item Find an upper bound for the length of all input sequences with different effects on the protection state w.r.t. safety
        If such can be found: $\exists$ a finite number of input sequences with different effects
        \item All these inputs can be tested whether they violate safety. This test terminates because:
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item each input sequence is finite
            \item there is only a finite number of relevant sequences
        \end{itemize*}
        \item[$\rightarrow$] safety is decidable
    \end{enumerate*}

    Proof: Transform $\sigma_1\dots \sigma_n$ into shorter sequences
    \begin{enumerate*}
        \item Remove all input operations that contain delete or destroy primitives (no absence, only presence of rights is checked).
        \item Prepend the sequence with an initial create subject $s_{init}$ operation.
        \item Prune the last create subject s operation and substitute each following reference to s with $s_{init}$. Repeat until all create subject operations are removed, except from the initial create subject $s_{init}$.
        \item Same as steps 2 and 3 for objects.
        \item Remove all redundant enter operations.
    \end{enumerate*}

    Conclusions from these Theorems (Dilemma)
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item General (unrestricted) HRU models
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item have strong expressiveness $\rightarrow$ can model a broad range of AC policies
            \item are hard to analyze: algorithms and tools for safety analysis
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Mono-operational HRU models
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item have weak expressiveness $\rightarrow$ goes as far as uselessness (only create files)
            \item efficient to analyze: algorithms and tools for safety analysis
            \item[$\rightarrow$] are always guaranteed to terminate
            \item[$\rightarrow$] are straight-forward to design
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{(A) Restricted Model Variants}

    Static HRU Models
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Static: no create primitives allowed
        \item safe(q,r) decidable, but NP-complete problem
        \item Applications: (static) real-time systems, closed embedded systems
    \end{itemize*}

    Monotonous Mono-conditional HRU Models
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Monotonous (MHRU): no delete or destroy primitives
        \item Mono-conditional: at most one clause in conditions part
        \item safe(q,r) efficiently decidable
        \item Applications: Archiving/logging systems (nothing is ever deleted)
    \end{itemize*}

    Finite Subject Set
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item $\forall q\in Q,\exists n\in N: |S_q|\leq n$
        \item $safe(q,r)$ decidable, but high computational complexity
    \end{itemize*}

    Fixed STS
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item All STS commands are fixed, match particular application domain (e.g. OS access control) $\rightarrow$ no model reusability
        \item For Lipton and Snyder [1977]: $safe(q,r)$ decidable in linear time
    \end{itemize*}

    Strong Type System
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Special model to generalize HRU: Typed Access Matrix (TAM)
        \item $safe(q,r)$ decidable in polynomial time for ternary, acyclic, monotonous variants
        \item high, though not unrestricted expressiveness in practice
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{(B) Heuristic Analysis Methods}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Restricted model variants often too weak for real-world apps
        \item General HRU models: safety property cannot be guaranteed
        \item[$\rightarrow$] get a piece from both: Heuristically guided safety estimation
    \end{itemize*}

    Idea:
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item State-space exploration by model simulation
        \item Task of heuristic: generating input sequences (educated guessing)
    \end{itemize*}

    Outline: Two-phase-algorithm to analyze $safe(q_0,r)$:
    \begin{enumerate*}
        \item Static phase: knowledge from model to make ,,good'' decisions
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item[$\rightarrow$] Runtime: polynomial in model size ($q_0 + STS$)
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Simulation phase: The automaton is implemented and, starting with $q_0$, fed with inputs $\sigma=<op,x>$
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item[$\rightarrow$] For each $\sigma$, the heuristic has to decide:
            \item which operation $op$ to use
            \item which vector of arguments $x$ to pass
            \item which $q_i$ to use from the states in $Q$ known so far
            \item Termination: As soon as $\sigma(q_i,\sigma)$ violates $safe(q_0,r)$.
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{enumerate*}

    Goal: Iteratively build up the $Q$ for a model to falsify safety by example (finding a violating but possible protection state).

    Termination: only a semi-decidable problem here. It can be guaranteed that a model is unsafe if we terminate. We cannot ever prove the opposite $\rightarrow$ safety undecidability
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Find typical errors in security policies: Guide designers, who might know thereâ€™s something wrong but not what and why
        \item Increase understanding of unsafety origins: By building clever heuristics, we started to understand how we might design specialized HRU models that are safety-decidable yet practically (re-)usable
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{The Typed-Access-Matrix Model (TAM)}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Adopted from HRU: subjects, objects, ACM, automaton
        \item New: leverage the principle of strong typing (like programming)
        \item[$\rightarrow$] safety decidability properties relate to type-based restrictions
        \item Foundation of a TAM model is an HRU model $\langle Q,\sum,\delta,q_0 ,R\rangle$, where $Q= 2^S\times 2^O\times M$
        \item However: $S\subseteq O$, i. e.:
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item all subjects can also act as objects (=targets of an access)
            \item useful for modeling e.g. delegation
            \item objects in $O\backslash S$: pure objects
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Each $o\in O$ has a type from a type set $T$ assigned through a mapping $type:O\rightarrow T$
        \item An HRU model is a special case of a TAM model:
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item $T=\{tSubject,tObject\}$
            \item $\forall s\in S:type(s)=tSubject; \forall o\in O\backslash S:type(o)=tObject$
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    \note{TAM Security Model}{A TAM model is a deterministic automaton $\langle Q,\sum,\delta,q_0 ,T,R\rangle$ where
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item $Q= 2^S\times 2^O\times TYPE\times M$ is the state space where $S$ and $O$ are subjects set and objects set as in HRU, where $S\subseteq O$, $TYPE=\{type|type:O\rightarrow T\}$ is a set of possible type functions, $M$ is the set of possible $ACMs$ as in HRU,
            \item $\sum=OP\times X$ is the (finite) input alphabet where $OP$ is a set of operations as in HRU, $X=O^k$ is a set of $k$-dimensional vectors of arguments (objects) of these operations,
            \item $\delta:Q\times\sum\rightarrow Q$ is the state transition function,
            \item $q_0\in Q$ is the initial state,
            \item $T$ is a static (finite) set of types,
            \item $R$ is a (finite) set of access rights.

    Convenience Notation where
    %\includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{Assets/Systemsicherheit-tam-sts-convenience.png}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item $q\in Q$ is implicit
        \item $op,r_1 ,\dots ,r_m,s_1 ,\dots ,s_m,o_1 ,\dots ,o_m$ as before
        \item $t_1 ,\dots ,t_k$ are argument types
        \item $p_1 ,\dots ,p_n$ are TAM-specific primitives

    TAM-specific
    %\includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{Assets/Systemsicherheit-tam-sts-specific.png}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Implicit Add-on: Type Checking where $t_i$ are the types of the arguments $x_i, 1\leq i\leq k$.
        \item Primitives:
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item enter r into m($x_s$,$x_o$)
            \item delete r from m($x_s$,$x_o$)
            \item create subject $x_s$ of type $t_s$
            \item create object $x_o$ of type $t_o$
            \item destroy subject $x_s$
            \item destroy object $x_o$
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Observation: $S$ and $O$ are dynamic (as in HRU), thus $type:O\rightarrow T$ must be dynamic too (cf. definition of $Q$ in TAM).
    \end{itemize*}

    TAM Example: The ORCON Policy
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Creator/owner of a document should permanently retain controlover its accesses
        \item Neither direct nor indirect (by copying) right proliferation
        \item Application scenarios: Digital rights management, confidential sharing
        \item Solution with TAM: A confined subject type that can never execute any operation other than reading
    \end{itemize*}

    Model Behavior (STS): The State Transition Scheme
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item $createOrconObject(s_1:s, o_1:co)$
        \item $grantCRead(s 1 :s,s 2 :s,o 1 :co)$
        \item $useCRead(s_1:s, o_1:co, s_2:cs)$
        \item $revokeCRead(s_1:s, s_2:s, o_1:co)$
        \item $destroyOrconObject(s_1:s, o_1:co)$ (destroy conf. object)
        \item $revokeRead(s_1:s, s_2:cs, o_1:co)$ (destroy conf. subject)
        \item $finishOrconRead(s_1:s, s_2:cs)$ (destroy conf. subject)
        \item Owner retains full control over
        \item Use of her confined objects by third parties $\rightarrow$ transitive right revocation
        \item Subjects using these objects $\rightarrow$ destruction of these subjects
        \item Subjects using such objects are confined: cannot forward read information
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{TAM Safety Decidability}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item General TAM models $\rightarrow$ safety not decidable
        \item \textbf{MTAM} monotonous TAM models; STS without delete or destroy primitives $\rightarrow$ safety decidable if mono-conditional only
        \item \textbf{AMTAM} acyclic MTAM models $\rightarrow$ safety decidable but not efficiently (NP-hard problem)
        \item \textbf{TAMTAM} ternary AMTAM models; each STS command requires max. 3 arguments $\rightarrow$ provably same computational power and thus expressive power as AMTAM; safety decidable in polynomial time
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{Acyclic TAM Models}

    \note{Parent- and Child-Types}{For any operation $op$ with arguments $\langle x_1,t_1\rangle ,\dots ,\langle x_k,t_k\rangle$ in an STS of a TAM model, it holds that $t_i, 1\leq i\leq k$
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item is a child type in op if one of its primitives creates a subject or object $x_i$ of type $t_i$,
            \item is a parent type in op if none of its primitives creates a subject or object $x_i$ of type $t_i$.
        \end{itemize*}
    }

    \note{Type Creation Graph}{The type creation graph $TCG=\langle T,E=T\times T\rangle$ for the STS of a TAM model is a directed graph with vertex set $T$ and an $edge\langle u,v\rangle \in E$ iff $\exists op\in OP:u$ is a parent type in $op\wedge v$ is a child type in op.}

        \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{Assets/Systemsicherheit-acyclic-tam-example.png}
        \columnbreak

        Note: In bar $u$ is both a parent type (because of $s_1$) and a child type (because of $s_2$) $\rightarrow$ hence the loop edge.
    \end{multicols}

    Safety Decidability: We call a TAM model acyclic, iff its TCG is acyclic.

    \note{Theorem 5}{Safety of a ternary, acyclic, monotonous TAM model (TAMTAM) is decidable in polynomial time in the size of $m_0$.}

    Crucial property acyclic, intuitively:
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Evolution of the system (protection state transitions) checks both rights in the ACM as well as argument types
        \item TCG is acyclic $\Rightarrow\exists$ a finite sequence of possible state transitions after which no input tuple with argument types, that were not already considered before, can be found
        \item One may prove that an algorithm, which tries to expandall possible different follow-up states from $q_0$, may terminate after this finite sequence
    \end{itemize*}

    Expressive Power of TAMTAM
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item MTAM: obviously same expressive power as monotonic HRU
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item no transfer of rights: ,,take r \dots  in turn grant r to \dots ''
            \item no countdown rights: ,,r can only be used n times''
        \end{itemize*}
        \item ORCON: allow to ignore non-monotonic command $s$ from STS since they only remove rights and are reversible
        \item AMTAM: most MTAM STS may be re-written as acyclic
        \item TAMTAM: expressive power equivalent to AMTAM

    \subsubsection{Roles-based Access Control Models (RBAC)}
    Solving Scalability and Abstraction results in smaller modeling effort results in smaller chance of human errors made in the process
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Improved scalability and manageability
        \item application-oriented semantic: $roles\approx functions$ in organizations
        \item Models include smart abstraction: roles
        \item AC rules are specified based on roles instead of identities
        \item Users, roles, and rights for executing operations
        \item Access rules are based on roles of users $\rightarrow$ on assignments
        \item improved Scalability
        \item improved Application-oriented model abstractions
        \item Standardization (RBAC96) $\rightarrow$ tool-support
        \item Limited dynamic analyses w.r.t. automaton-based models
    \end{itemize*}

    \note{Basic RBAC model}{An $RBAC_0$ model is a tuple $\langle U,R,P,S,UA,PA,user,roles\rangle$ where
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item U is a set of user identifiers,
            \item R is a set of role identifiers,
            \item P is a set of permission identifiers,
            \item S is a set of session identifiers,
            \item $UA\subseteq U\times R$ is a many-to-many user-role-relation,
            \item $PA\subseteq P\times R$ is a many-to-many permission-role-relation,
            \item $user:S\rightarrow U$ is a total function mapping sessions to users,
            \item $roles:S\rightarrow 2^R$ is a total function mapping sessions to sets of roles such that $\forall s\in S:r\in roles(s)\Rightarrow \langle user(s),r\rangle \in UA$.
        \end{itemize*}
    }

    Interpretation
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Users U model people: actual humans that operate the AC system
        \item Roles R model functions, originate from workflows/responsibility
        \item Permissions P model rights for any particular access
        \item user-role-relation $UA\subseteq U\times R$ defines which roles are available to users at any given time $\rightarrow$ assumed during runtime before usable
        \item permission-role-relation $PA\subseteq P\times R$
        \item $UA$ and $PA$ describe static policy rules
        \item Sessions $S$ describe dynamic assignments of roles $\rightarrow$ a session $s\in S$ models when a user is logged in
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item $S\rightarrow U$ associates a session with its (,,owning'') user
            \item $S\rightarrow 2^R$ associates a session with the set of roles currently assumed by that user (active roles)

    \paragraph{RBAC Access Control Function}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item access rules have to be defined for operations on objects
        \item implicitly defined through $P\rightarrow$ made explicit: $P\subseteq O\times OP$ is a set of permission tuples $\langle o,op\rangle$ where
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item $o\in O$ is an object from a set of object identifiers,
            \item $op\in OP$ is an operation from a set of operation identifiers.
        \end{itemize*}
        \item We may now define the $ACF$ for $RBAC_0$
    \end{itemize*}

    \note{$RBAC_0$ ACF}{
        $f_{RBAC_0}:U \times O\times OP\rightarrow\{true,false\}$ where
        $\begin{cases} true, \quad \exists r\in R,s\in S:u=user(s)\wedge r\in roles(s)\wedge \langle \langle o,op\rangle ,r\rangle \in PA \\ false, \quad\text{ otherwise } \end{cases}$
    }

    \paragraph{RBAC96 Model Family}
    In practice, organizations have more requirements that need to be expressed in their security policy
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item $RBAC_1 = RBAC_0 + hierarchies$
        \item $RBAC_2 = RBAC_0 + constraints$
        \item $RBAC_3 = RBAC_0 + RBAC_1 + RBAC_2$
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{RBAC 1: Role Hierarchies}
    Roles often overlap
    \begin{enumerate*}
        \item disjoint permissions for roles $\rightarrow$ any user X must always have Y assigned and activated for any of her workflows $\rightarrow$ role assignment redundancy
        \item overlapping permissions: $\forall p\in P:\langle p,proDev\rangle \in PA\Rightarrow \langle p,proManager\rangle \in PA\rightarrow$ any permission must be assigned to two different roles $\rightarrow$ role definition redundancy
        \item Two types of redundancy $\rightarrow$ undermines scalability goal of RBAC
    \end{enumerate*}

    Solution: Role hierarchy $\rightarrow$ Eliminates role definition redundancy through permissions inheritance

    Modeling Role Hierarchies: Lattice here: $\langle R,\leq\rangle$
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Hierarchy expressed through dominance relation: $r_1\leq r_2 \Leftrightarrow r_2$ inherits any permissions from $r_1$
        \item \textbf{Reflexivity} any role consists of its own permissions
        \item \textbf{Antisymmetry} no two different roles may mutually inherit their respective permissions
        \item \textbf{Transitivity} permissions may be inherited indirectly
    \end{itemize*}

    \note{$RBAC_1$ Security Model}{An $RBAC_1$ model is a tuple $\langle U,R,P,S,UA,PA,user,roles,RH\rangle$ where
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item $U,R,P,S,UA,PA$ and $user$ are defined as for $RBAC_0$,
            \item $RH\subseteq R\times R$ is a partial order that represents a role hierarchy where $\langle r,r'\rangle \in RH\Leftrightarrow r\leq r'$ such that $\langle R,\leq\rangle$ is a lattice,
            \item roles is defined as for $RBAC_0$, while additionally holds: $\forall r,r'\in R,\exists s\in S:r\leq r'\wedge r'\in roles(s)\Rightarrow r\in roles(s)$.
        \end{itemize*}
    }

    \paragraph{RBAC 2: Constraints}
    roles in org. often more restricted
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Certain roles may not be active at the same time (session) for any user
        \item Certain roles may not be together assigned to any user
        \item[$\rightarrow$] separation of duty (SoD)
        \item While SoD constraints are a more fine-grained type of security requirements to avoid mission-critical risks, there are other types represented by RBAC constraints
    \end{itemize*}
    Constraint Types
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item \textbf{Separation of duty} mutually exclusive roles
        \item \textbf{Quantitative constraints} maximum number of roles per user
        \item \textbf{Temporal constraints} time/date/week/\dots  of role activation
        \item \textbf{Factual constraints} assigning or activating roles for specific permissions causally depends on any roles for a certain
    \end{itemize*}
    Modeling Constraints Idea
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item $RBAC_2: \langle U,R,P,S,UA,PA,user,roles,RE\rangle$
        \item $RBAC_3: \langle U,R,P,S,UA,PA,user,roles,RH,RE\rangle$
        \item where $RE$ is a set of logical expressions over the other model components (such as $UA,PA,user,roles$)
    \end{itemize*}

    \subsubsection{Attribute-based Access Control Models (ABAC)}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Scalability and manageability
        \item Application-oriented model abstractions
        \item Model semantics meet functional requirements of open systems:
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item user IDs, INode IDs, \dots only available locally
            \item roles limited to specific organizational structure
        \end{itemize*}
        \item[$\rightarrow$] application-specific context of access: attributes of subjects and objects (e. g. age, location, trust level, \dots )
    \end{itemize*}

    Idea: Generalizing the principle of indirection already known from RBAC

    Abstraction level of AC Models: rules about subjects accessing objects.

    Goal: Problem-oriented definition of policy rules for scenarios based on information flows(rather than access rights)
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Information flows and read/write operations are isomorphic
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item s has read permission o $\Leftrightarrow$ information flow from o to s

    Analysis of Information Flow Models
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item IF Transitivity $\rightarrow$ goal: covert information flows
        \item IF Antisymmetry $\rightarrow$ goal: redundancy

    \subsubsection{Multilevel Security (MLS)}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Introducing a hierarchy of information flow classes: levels of trust

            \item Objects w.r.t. their criticality

        \item Composition of
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Discretionary IBAC components

            \item Attribute-based model
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Application areas: consulting, cloud computing
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{The Brewer-Nash Model}
    tailored towards Chinese Wall

    Model Abstractions
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Consultants represented by subjects
        \item Client companies represented by objects
        \item Modeling of competition by conflict classes: two different clients are competitors $\Leftrightarrow$ their objects belong to the same class
        \item No information flow between competing objects $\rightarrow$ a ,,wall'' separating any two objects from the same conflict class
        \item Additional ACM for refined management settings of access permissions
    \end{itemize*}

    Representation of Conflict Classes
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Client company data: object set O
        \item Competition: conflict relation $C\subseteq O\times O:\langle o,o'\rangle \in C\Leftrightarrow o$ and $o'$ belong to competing companies
        \item object attribute $att_O:O\rightarrow 2^O$, such that $att_O(o)=\{o'\in O|\langle o,o'\rangle \in C\}$
    \end{itemize*}

    Representation of a Consultantâ€™s History
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Consultants: subject set S
        \item History $H\subseteq S\times O:\langle s,o\rangle \in H\Leftrightarrow s$ has previously consulted $o$
        \item subject attribute $att_S:S\rightarrow 2^O$, such that $att_S(s)=\{o\in O|\langle s,o\rangle \in H\}$

            \item $q_0\in Q$ is the initial state,
            \item $R=\{read,write\}$ is the set of access rights.
        \end{itemize*}
    }

    \paragraph{Brewer-Nash STS}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Read (similar to HRU notation)
        command read(s,o)::=if read $\in$ m(s,o) $\wedge\forall \langle o',o\rangle \in C:\langle s,o'\rangle \not\in H$
        then

        fi
    \end{itemize*}

    $\rightarrow$ modifications in m to enable fine-grained rights management.
    Restrictiveness:
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Write Command: s is allowed to write $o\Leftrightarrow write\in m(s,o)\wedge\forall o'\in O:o'\not=o\Rightarrow\langle s,o'\rangle \not\in H$

    \paragraph{Brewer-Nash Model}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Initial State $q_0$, $H_0 =\varnothing$
        \item $m_0$: consultant assignments to clients, issued by management

    \paragraph{The Least-Restrictive-CW Model}

    Restrictiveness of Brewer-Nash Model:
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item If $\langle o_i,o_k\rangle \in C$: no transitive information flow $o_i \rightarrow o_j\rightarrow o_k$
        \item more restrictive than necessary: $o_j\rightarrow o_k$ and later $o_i\rightarrow o_j$ fine
        \item Criticality of an IF depends on existence of earlier flows.
    \end{itemize*}

    Idea LR-CW: Include time as a model abstraction!
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item $\forall s\in S,o\in O$: remember, which information has flown to entity
        \item[$\rightarrow$] subject-/object-specific history, $\approx$attributes (,,lables'')
    \end{itemize*}

    \note{Least-Restrictive CW model}{ of the CW policy is a deterministic $automaton \langle S,O,F,\zeta,Q,\sigma,\delta,q_0\rangle$ where
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item S and O are sets of subjects (consultants) and data objects,
            \item F is the set of client companies,
            \item $\zeta:O\rightarrow F$ (,,zeta'') function mapping each object to its company,
            \item $Q=2^C \times 2^H$ is the state space where
            \begin{itemize*}
                \item $C\subseteq F\times F$ is the conflict relation: $\langle f,f'\rangle \in C\Leftrightarrow f$ and $f'$ are competitors,
                \item $H=\{Z_e\subseteq F|e\in S\cup O\}$ is the history set: $f\in Z_e\Leftrightarrow e$ contains information about $f(Z_e$ is the ,,history label'' of $e$),
            \end{itemize*}
            \item $\sigma=OP\times X$ is the input alphabet where
            \begin{itemize*}
                \item $OP=\{read,write\}$ is the set of operations,
                \item $X=S\times O$ is the set of arguments of these operations,
            \end{itemize*}
            \item $\delta:Q\times\sigma\rightarrow Q$ is the state transition function,
            \item $q_0\in Q$ is the initial state
        \end{itemize*}
    }

    \begin{itemize*}
        \item reading: requires that no conflicting information is accumulated in the subject potentially increases the amount of information in the subject
        \item writing: requires that no conflicting information is accumulated in the object potentially increases the amount of information in the object
    \end{itemize*}

    Model Achievements
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Applicability: more writes allowed in comparison to Brewer-Nash
        \item Paid for with
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Need to store individual attributes of all entities (history)
            \item Need of write permissions on earlier actions of subjects
        \end{itemize*}
        \item More extensions:
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Operations to modify conflict relation
            \item Operations to create/destroy entities
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    \subsubsection{An MLS Model for Chinese-Wall Policies}
    Conflict relation is
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item non-reflexive: no company is a competitor of itself
        \item symmetric: competition is always mutual
        \item not necessarily transitive: any company might belong to more than one conflict class $\rightarrow$ Cannot be modeled by a lattice
    \end{itemize*}

    Idea: Labeling of entities
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Class of an entity (subject or object) reflects information it carries
        \item Consultant reclassified whenever a company data object is read
        \item[$\rightarrow$] Classes and labels:
        \item Class set of a lattice $C=\{DB,Citi,Shell,Esso\}$
        \item Entity label: vector of information already present in each business branch
    \end{itemize*}

        \item Implemented e.g. as list, table, bitmap
        \item Part of objectâ€˜s metadata (generally located in inode)
    \end{itemize*}

    Create and Delete an ACL
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Together with creation and deletion of an object
        \item Initial rights are create operation parameters $\rightarrow$ discretionary access control
        \item Initial rights issued by third party$\rightarrow$ mandatory access control
    \end{itemize*}

    Modify an ACL
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Add or remove tuples (subject identification, right set)
        \item Owner has right to modify ACL $\rightarrow$ discretionary access control
        \item Third party has right to modify ACL $\rightarrow$ mandatory access control
        \item Right to modify ACL is part of ACL $\rightarrow$ universal
    \end{itemize*}

    Check Rights
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Whenever an object is accessed
        \item Search granting tuple in ACL
    \end{itemize*}

    Negative Rights
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Dominate positive rights
        \item represented by tuples (subject identification, negative rights set)
        \item Rights of subject: difference of positive and negative rights
    \end{itemize*}

    \begin{multicols}{2}
    Example: ACLs in Unix
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item 3 elements per list list
        \item 3 elements per right set

    Create and Delete
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Together with creation and deletion of a subject
        \item Initial rights same as parent $\rightarrow$ inherited

    Passing on Capabilities, options:
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Emission and call-back by capability owner $\rightarrow$ discretionary access control
        \item Emission and call-back by third party $\rightarrow$ mandatory access control
        \item Emission and call-back controlled by capability itself $\rightarrow$ universal
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{$\delta s$ in Administration}
    ACLs: Located near objects $\rightarrow$ finding all rights of a subject expensive

    Example BLP: re-classification of a subject $\rightarrow$ update every ACL with rights of this subject

    Group models; e.g.
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item BLP: subjects with same classification
        \item Unix: subjects belonging to project staff
    \end{itemize*}

    Role models (role: set of rights); e.g. set of rights wrt. objects with same classification

    \paragraph{$\delta s$ in Distributed Systems}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item No encapsulation of subject ids/ACLs in single trustworthy OS
        \item No encapsulation of cap. lists in a single trustworthy OS kernel

            \item Checking of capabilities and subject ids on objectâ€™s system
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    Vulnerabilities and Counteractions
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Subjectâ€™s system may fake subject ids
        \item Consequence: Reliable subject authentication required $\rightarrow$ authentication architectures (e.g. Kerberos)
        \item Non-trustworthy subject systems modify capabilities
        \begin{itemize*}

            \item Issuer can be determined
            \item Modification can be detected
            \item sealing e.g. by digital signatures
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Non-trustworthy subject systems pass capabilities to third parties or are copied by third parties while in transit $\rightarrow$ personalized
        \item Exploit stolen capabilities by forging subject id
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item[$\rightarrow$] cryptographically sealed personalized capabilities
            \item[$\rightarrow$] reliable subject authentication required
            \item[$\rightarrow$] authentication architectures
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{Expressive Power of ACLs and Capability Lists}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Efficient data structures for implementing ACMs/ACFs
        \item Located in OSs, middleware, DBMSe, application systems
        \item Correctness, tamperproofness, total S/O interaction mediation vital for enforcing access control $\rightarrow$ implementation by strong architectural principles
        \item Assume reliable authentication of subjects and objects $\rightarrow$ support by further security mechanisms
        \item Are too weak to implement complex security policies
        \item Not sufficient for implementing more complex security policies $\rightarrow$ Authorization schemes
    \end{itemize*}

    \subsubsection{Interceptors}
    Policy implementation by algorithms instead of lists
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Tamperproof runtime environments for security policies
        \item In total control of subject/object interactions (Observation, Modification, Prevention)
    \end{itemize*}

    General Architectural Principle: Separation of
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item (Replaceable) strategies
        \item (Strategy-independent) mechanisms
    \end{itemize*}

    Applied to Interceptors $\rightarrow$ 2 Parts
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Runtime environment for security policies (strategies)
        \begin{itemize*}

        \end{itemize*}
        \item Interception points (mechanisms)
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item often called ,,policy enforcement points'' (PEP)

    \subsection{Cryptographic Security Mechanisms}
    Encryption: Transformation of a plaintext into a ciphertext
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item 2 functions encrypt, decrypt
        \item 2 keys k1, k2
        \item $text = decrypt_{k2}(encrypt_{k1}(text))$ or simply
        \item $text = \{\{text\}_{k1}\}_{k2}$ (if encryption function is obvious)
        \item Symmetric schemes (secret key): one single key: $k1=k2$
        \item Asymmetric schemes (public key): two different keys: $K1\not=K2$
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{Kerkhoffâ€™s Principle}
    \begin{enumerate*}
        \item Encryption functions (algorithms) are publicly known
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item[$\rightarrow$] many experts look at it
            \item[$\rightarrow$] quality advantage assumed
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Keys are secret
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item[$\rightarrow$] encryption security depends on
            \item Properties of algorithms
            \item Confidentiality of keys
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{enumerate*}

    \paragraph{Symmetric Encryption Schemes}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Encryption and decryption with same key
        \item[$\rightarrow$] security based on keeping key secret
        \item Example: shift letters of a ciphertext forward by K positions
    \end{itemize*}

    Application Examples
    \begin{enumerate*}
        \item Confidentiality of Communication (Assumptions)
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Sender and receiver share key k , which has to be established before communication, Authentically, Confidentially
            \item Nobody else must know $k(secretkey)$
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Authentication: client to server (by shared secret key)
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Each client shares an individual and secret key $k_{client}$ with server
            \item Server and clients keep key secret
            \item Server reliably generates a nonce (=never sent once before )
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Sealing of Documents, e.g. Capabilities
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item 1 key owner $\rightarrow$ owner may
            \begin{itemize*}
                \item seal document
                \item check whether seal is sound
            \end{itemize*}
            \item Group of key owners $\rightarrow$ each group membermay
            \begin{itemize*}
                \item Seal document
                \item Check whether seal was impressed by group member
                \item[$\rightarrow$] nobody in this group can prove it was him or not
            \end{itemize*}
            \item Outside the group $\rightarrow$ nobody can do any of these things
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{enumerate*}

    Algorithms: Block and Stream Ciphers
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Block cipher
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Decompose plaintext into blocks of equal size (e.g. 64 bits)
            \item Encrypt each block
            \item e.g. Data Encryption Standard (DES) obsolete since 1998
            \item e.g. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) (128bits length)
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Stream cipher
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Encrypt each digit of a plaintext stream by a cipher digit stream (e.g. by XOR)
            \item Cipher digit stream: pseudo-random digit stream
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{Asymmetric Encryption Schemes}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item[$\rightarrow$] key pair $(k1,k2) = (k_{pub} , k_{sec})$ where
        \item $decrypt_{k_{sec}} ( encrypt_{k_{pub}} (text)) = text$
        \item Conditio sine qua non: Secret key not computable from public key
    \end{itemize*}

    Application Examples
    \begin{enumerate*}
        \item Confidentiality of Communication (compare symmetric encryption schemes)
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Sender shares no secret with receiver $\rightarrow$ No trust between sender and receiver necessary
            \item Sender must know public key of receiver $\rightarrow$ public-key-Infrastructures (PKIs) containing key certificates
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Authentication: using public key
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Each client owns an individual key pair ($k_{pub}, k_{sec}$)
            \item Server knows public keys of clients (PKI)
            \item Clients are not disclosing secret key
            \item Server reliably generates nonces
            \item Properties
            \begin{itemize*}
                \item Client and server share no secrets
                \item No key exchange before communication
                \item No mutual trust required
                \item But: sender must know public key of receiver
                \item[$\rightarrow$] PKIs
            \end{itemize*}
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Sealing of Documents, compare sealing using secret keys
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item $\exists$ just 1 owner of secret key $\rightarrow$ only she may seal contract
            \item Knowing her public key,
            \begin{itemize*}
                \item[$\rightarrow$] everybody can check contractâ€™s authenticity
                \item[$\rightarrow$] everybody can prove that she was the sealer
                \item[$\rightarrow$] repudiability: digital signatures
            \end{itemize*}
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{enumerate*}

    Consequence of Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item[Sym] shared key, integrity and authenticity can be checked only by key holders $\rightarrow$ message authentication codes (MACs)
        \item[Asym] integrity and authenticity can be checked by anyone holding public key (only holder of secret key could have encrypted the checksum) $\rightarrow$ digital signatures
    \end{itemize*}

    Key Distribution for Symmetric Schemes
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Asymmetric encryption is expensive
        \item Key pairs generation (High computational costs, trust needed)
        \item Public Key Infrastructures needed for publishing public keys
        \item[$\rightarrow$] Use asymmetric key for establishing communication
        \item Use symmetric encryption for communication
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{RSA Cryptosystem (Rivest/Shamir/Adleman)}
    Attractive because $encrypt=decrypt$ $\rightarrow$ universal:
    \begin{enumerate*}
        \item Confidentiality
        \item Integrity and authenticity (non repudiability, digital signatures)
    \end{enumerate*}
    For $n\in\mathbb{N}$ we search 2 primes $p$ and $q$ such that $n=p*q$
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item[$\rightarrow$] hard problem because for factorization, prime numbers are needed
        \item There are many of them, approx. $7*10^{151}$
        \item Finding them is extremely expensive: Sieve of Eratosthenes
        \item Optimization: Atkinâ€™s Sieve, $O(n^{1/2+O(1)})$
        \item Until today, no polynomial factorization algorithm is known
        \item Until today, nobody proved that such algorithm cannot exist\dots
    \end{itemize*}
    Precautions in PKIs: Prepare for fast exchange of cryptosystem

    \subsubsection{Cryptographic Hash Functions}
    Discover violation of integrity of data, so that integrity of information is maintained.
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Checksum generation by cryptographic hash functions
        \item Checksum encryption
        \item Integrity check by
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Generating a new checksum
            \item Decryption of encrypted checksum
            \item Comparison of both values
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    Method of Operation: Map data of arbitrary length to checksum of fixed length such that $Text1 \not= Text2 \Rightarrow hash(Text1) \not= hash(Text2)$ with high probability

    \begin{itemize*}
        \item 160 - Bit checksums: RIPEMD-160 (obsolete since 2015)
        \item Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1, published NIST 1993)
        \item Larger Checksums: SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512
        \item 128-Bit: Message Digest (MD5 (1992)) (no longer approved)
        \item MD5: belongs to IPsec algorithm group, used also in SSL
    \end{itemize*}

    \subsubsection{Digital Signatures}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item assert author of a document (signer) $\rightarrow$ Authenticity
        \item discover modifications after signing $\rightarrow$ Integrity $\rightarrow$ non repudiability
    \end{itemize*}

    Approach
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Create signature
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Integrity: create checksum $\rightarrow$ cryptographic hash function
            \item Authenticity: encrypt checksum $\rightarrow$ use private key of signer
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Check signature
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Decrypt checksum using public key of signer
            \item Compare result with newly created checksum
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

        \item Method: challenge/response-scheme
        \item Based on symmetric \& asymmetric key
    \end{itemize*}
    The 2 fundamental Scenarios
    \begin{enumerate*}
        \item After one single authentication, Alice wants to use all servers in a distributed system of an organization.
        \item Alice wants authentic and confidential communication with Bob. Authentication Server serves session keys to Bob and Alice
    \end{enumerate*}

    Needham-Schroeder Authentication Protocol (for secret keys)

    %Note: Protocol used in Kerberos security architecture

    Message Semantics
    \begin{enumerate*}
        \item $A\rightarrow S:A,B,N_A$: A requests session key for B from S
        \item $S\rightarrow A:\{N_A,B,K_{AB},K_{AB},A\}_{KBS}\}_{KAS}$: S responds encrypted with $K_{AS}$ such that only A is able to understand
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item nonce proves that 2. is a reply to 1. (fresh)
            \item session key $K_{AB}$
            \item ticket for B; encryption proves $K_{AB}$ was generated by $S$
        \end{itemize*}
        \item $A\rightarrow B:\{K_{AB},A\}_{KBS}$: A ticket to B; encryption as challenge
        \item $B\rightarrow A:\{N_B\}_{KAB}$: B decrypts ticket \& verifies if A knows $K_{AB}$
        \item $A\rightarrow B:\{N_B-1\}_{KAB}$: A proves by using $K_{AB}$ that he was the sender of 3. (response)
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Authentication of A to B: only A can decrypt 2.
            \item Authentication of B to A: only B can decrypt 3.
            \item A and B now also share a secret session key
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{enumerate*}

    Authentication Servers
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Common trust in server by all principals $\rightarrow$ closed user group
        \item Server shares individual secret with each principal (sym key)
    \end{itemize*}

    Needham-Schroeder Authentication Protocol for public keys
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item establish authentic and confidential communication between Principals
        \item Premise: Trust
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Individually in issuer of certificate (certification authority)
            \item[$\rightarrow$] much weaker than secret key based authentication
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Message Semantics
        \begin{enumerate*}
            \item $A\rightarrow S:A,B$: A requests public key of B
            \item $S\rightarrow A:\{PK_B,B\}_{SK_S}$: S sends certificate; A knows public key of CA

            \item $S\rightarrow B:\{PK_A,A\}_{SK_S}$: S responds (see 2.)
            \item $B\rightarrow A:\{N_A, N_B\}_{PK_A}$: B proves it is B and challenges A
            \item $A\rightarrow B:\{N_B\}_{PK_B}$: A replies and proves it is A
        \end{enumerate*}
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Authentication of A to B: 6. together with 7.
            \item Authentication of B to A: 3. together with 6.
            \item From where key certificates are obtained is irrelevant
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    Certificate Servers: Basis of Authentication
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Key certificates
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Digitally signed mappings (name $\leftrightarrow$ public key)
            \item Issued by certification authorities (CA)
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Certificate servers
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Manage certificate data base
            \item Need not be trustworthy

    $\delta s$ between Secret Key and Public Key Authentication
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Secret Key Authentication
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Requires common trust in AS, a-priori key exchange and mutual trust in keeping session key secret
            \item Allows for message authentication codes
            \item Require online AS
            \item accumulation of secrets at AS $\rightarrow$ dangerous, server always online
            \item n keys for authenticating n principals
            \item $O(n^2)$ session keys for n communicating parties
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Public Key Authentication
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Requires knowledge of public keys $\rightarrow$ PKIs
            \item Allows for digital signatures
            \item Allow for local chaching of certificates
            \item n keys for authenticating n principals

    \section{Security Architectures}
    Security architectures have been around for a long time \dots
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Architecture Components (Buildings, walls, windows,\dots )
        \item Architecture (Component arrangement and interaction)
        \item Build a stronghold such that security policies can be enforced
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Presence of necessary components/mechanisms
            \item Totality of interaction control (,,mediation'')
            \item Tamperproofness
            \item[$\rightarrow$] architecture design principles
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    Check your trust in
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Completeness of access mediation (and its verification!)
        \item Policy tamperproofness(and its verification!)
        \item TCB correctness (and its verification!)
    \end{itemize*}

    Problem Areas PDPs/PEPs are
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Scattered among many OS components $\rightarrow$ Problem of architecture
        \item Not robust
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Not isolated from errors within the entire OS
            \item Especially in dynamically loaded OS modules
            \item[$\rightarrow$] Problem of security architecture implementation
        \end{itemize*}
        \item OSes/Middleware/Applications are big
        \item Only a small set of their functions logically belongs to the TCB
        \item[$\rightarrow$] architecture design such that TCB functions are collected
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item not bypassable (total access mediation),
            \item isolated (tamperproofness),
            \item trustworthy (verifiable correctness) core
            \item[$\rightarrow$] architecture such that these properties are enforced
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    \subsection{Architecture Design Principles}
    Definitions of fundamental security architecture design principles
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Complete
        \item Tamperproof
        \item Verifiably correct
        \item control of all security-relevant actions in a system
    \end{itemize*}

    \subsubsection{The Reference Monitor Principles}
    There exists an architecture component that is
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item[RM1] Involved in any subject/object interaction $\rightarrow$ total mediation property
        \item[RM2] Well-isolated from the rest of the systems $\rightarrow$ tamperproofness
        \item[RM3] Small and well-structured enough to analyze correctness by formal methods $\rightarrow$ verifiability
    \end{itemize*}

    architecture component built along these: ,,Reference Monitor''
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item 1 PDP (policy implementation)
        \item many PEPs (interceptors, policy enforcement)
    \end{itemize*}

    Reference Monitor
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Core component of a TCB
        \item Typically encloses
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Security policy implementation(s) (PDP)
            \begin{itemize*}
                \item Model state (e.g. ACM, subject set, entity attributes)
                \item Model behavioral logic (e.g.authorization scheme)
            \end{itemize*}
            \item Enforcement mechanisms: PEPs
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Typically excludes (due to complexity and size, RM 3)
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Authentication
            \item Cryptographic mechanisms
            \item Sometimes also model state (e.g.ACLs)
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    Consequences of (RM 3) for TCBs
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Few functions $\rightarrow$ small size (LoC)
        \item Simple functions $\rightarrow$ low complexity
        \item Strong isolation
        \item Precisely known perimeter
    \end{itemize*}

            \item Legacy Applications (,,legacy'' = unmodified for security)

    Concepts/Reference monitor principles:
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Separation of OS, Applications into security-critical vs. non-critical components $\rightarrow$ precise identification of (minimal) TCB

        \item Example: Email Client
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Non-critical: reading/composing/sending emails
            \item Critical: signing emails (email-client $\leftrightarrow$ Enigmail Signer)
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

        \item Functionality of legacy OSes and applications preserved
        \item (Moderate) performance penalties
        \item Paravirtualization of legacy OS
        \item Decomposition of trusted applications

        \item State-of-the-art security paradigms
        \item[$\rightarrow$] Policy-controlled (Linux) (Security-aware) OS kernel
    \end{itemize*}

    Security Policies in SELinux
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Implementation by new OS abstractions
        \item Somewhat comparable to ,,process'' abstraction
        \item Specification of a\dots
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item process is a program: algorithm implemented in formal language
            \item security policy is a security model: rule set in formal language
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Runtime environment (RTE) of a \dots
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item process is OSprocess management $\rightarrow$ RTE for application-level programs
            \item security policy is OS security Server $\rightarrow$ RTE for kernel-level policies
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    SELinux Architecture
    %\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Assets/Systemsicherheit-selinux-architecture.png}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Policy-aware Security Server (policy decision point, PDP) $\rightarrow$ Policy RTE in kernelâ€˜s protection domain
        \item Interceptors (policy enforcement points, PEPs) $\rightarrow$ Total interaction control in object managers
    \end{itemize*}

    Implementation Concepts
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Reference Monitor Principles
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Total mediation of security-relevant interactions $\rightarrow$ placement of PEPs: Integration into object managers
            \item Tamperproofness of policy implementation $\rightarrow$ placement of PDP: Integration into kernel
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Policy Support
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Authenticity of entities: Unique subject/object identifiers
            \item Policy-specific entity attributes (type, role, MLS label)
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Problem in Linux,
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Subject identifiers (PIDs) or object identifiers (i-node numbers) are
            \begin{itemize*}
                \item neither unique
                \item nor are of uniform type
            \end{itemize*}
            \item[$\rightarrow$] security identifier (SID)
            \item Policy-specific subject/object attributes (type, role) are not part of subject/object metadata $\rightarrow$ security context
            \item[$\rightarrow$] Approach: Extensions of process/file/socket\dots -management
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    Authenticity of Entities
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Object managers help: implement injective mapping SEO $\rightarrow$ SID
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item SID created by security server
            \item Mapping of SIDs to objects by object managers
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}
    %\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Assets/Systemsicherheit-object-managers.png}

    Entity Attributes

        \item sec. policy implements injective mapping SID $\rightarrow$ security context
        \item sec. contexts creation according to policy-specific labeling rules
        \item Entry in SID $\rightarrow$ security context mapping table
    \end{itemize*}

    Security Context contains
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Standard entity attributes such as user ID, Role, Type
        \item Policy-specific entity attributes such as Confidentiality/clearance level (e.g. MLS label)
        \item is implemented as a text string with policy-dependent format
    \end{itemize*}

    Problem: Security contexts of persistent Entities
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Policies not aware of persistency of entities $\rightarrow$ persistency of security contexts is job of object managers
        \item Layout of object metadata is file system standard $\rightarrow$ security contexts cannot be integrated in i-nodes (their implementation: policy-independent)
    \end{itemize*}

    Solution
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Persistent objects additionally have persistent SID : ,,PSID''
        \item OMs map these to SID
        \item 3 invisible storage areas in persistent memory implementing
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Security context of file system itself (label)
            \item Bijective mapping: inode $\rightarrow$ PSID
            \item Bijective mapping: PSID $\rightarrow$ security context
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    Access Vector Cache(AVC)
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Located in object managers (user level) resp. in Security Server (kernel level)
        \item Caches access decisions
    \end{itemize*}

    RM Evaluation of SELinux
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Compliance with Reference Monitor Principles
        \item Total Mediation Property (placement of PEPs) done manually
        \item Tamperproofness of Policy Implementation
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Fundamental problem in monolithic software architectures
            \item[$\rightarrow$] TCB implementation vulnerable from entire OS kernel code
            \item Security server, All object managers, Memory management,\dots
            \item It can be done: Nizza
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Verifiability
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Size and complexity of policy $\rightarrow$ analysis tools
            \item Policyâ€˜s RTE claim to be universal
            \item Completeness of PEPs

            \item Authorization Server (TGS)
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Authentication Server (AS)
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Authenticates users; Based on key shared between user and AS. Result: authenticator (electronic ID card)
            \item Authorizes use of TGS. Based on key shared between AS and TGS. Result: ticket (capability) for TGS
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Ticket Granting Server (TGS): Issues tickets for all servers
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Based on key shared between TGS and respective server

        \item Specify right of one client to use one server (capability)
        \item Limited lifetime (to make cryptographic attacks difficult)
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item balance between secure and convenient
            \item Short: inconvenient but more secure (if stolen soon expires)
            \item Long: insecure but more convenient (no frequent renewal)
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Can be used multiply while valid
        \item Are sealed by TGS with key of server
    \end{itemize*}

    %$T_{Client/Server}=\{Client, Server, Client.NetworkAddress, Timestamp, Lifetime, SessionKey_{Client/Server}\}_{KTGS/Server}$

    Provisions against Misuse
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Tampering by client to fabricate rights for different server $\rightarrow$ guarantee of integrity by MAC using $K_{TGS/Server}$
        \item Use by third party intercepting ticket $\rightarrow$ personalization by Name and network address of client together with Limited lifetime \&Authenticator of client
    \end{itemize*}

    Authenticators
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Proof of identity of client to server
        \item Created using $SessionKey_{Client/Server}$
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item[$\rightarrow$] can be created and checked only by
            \item Client (without help by AS, client knows session key )
            \item Server
            \item TGS (trusted)
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Can be used exactly once $\rightarrow$ prevent replay attacks by checking freshness
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{Kerberos Login}
    %The Complete Process \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Assets/Systemsicherheit-kerberos-login.png}
    %Single Steps:
    \begin{enumerate*}
        \item Alice tells her name
        \item Aliceâ€™s workstation requests authentication
        \item The AS
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Create fresh timestamp
            \item Create session key for Alice communication with the TGS % $SessionKey_{Alice/TGS}$
            \item Create Alice ticket for TGS and encrypt it with $K_{AS/TGS}$ %(so Alice cannot modify it): $Ticket_{Alice/TGS}=\{Alice, TGS, \dots , SessionKey_{Alice/TGS}\}_{K_{AS/TGS}}$
            \item Encrypts everything with $K_{Alice/AS}$ (only Alice can read the session key and the TGS-Ticket) %$\{TGS, Timestamp , SessionKey_{Alice/TGS}, Ticket_{Alice/TGS}\}_{K_{Alice/AS}}$
        \end{itemize*}
        \item Aliceâ€™s workstation
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item $TGS, Timestamp, SessionKey_{Alice/TGS} , Ticket_{Alice/TGS}$
            \item Requests Aliceâ€™s password
            \item Get $K_{Alice/AS}$ from password using cryptographic hash
            \item Uses it to decrypt above message from AS
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{enumerate*}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Result: Aliceâ€™s workstation has
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Session key for TGS session: $SessionKey_{Alice/TGS}$
            \item Ticket for TGS: $Ticket_{Alice/TGS}$
            \item The means to create an authenticator
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{itemize*}

    \paragraph{Using a Server}
    Authentication (bidirectional)
    \begin{enumerate*}
        \item Authentication of Client (to server)
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item (Assumption) Alice has session key
            \item (Assumption) Alice has server ticket
        \end{itemize*}
        \begin{enumerate*}
            \item Alice assembles authenticator $A_{Alice}$ %=\{Alice,Alice\_network\_address,timestamp\}_{SessionKey_{Alice/Server}}$ Only Alice can do that, because only she knows $SessionKey_{Alice/Server}$
            \item Alice sends $Ticket_{Alice/Server}, A_{Alice}$ to Server
            \item Server decrypts ticket and thus gets session key; thus it can decrypt $A_{Alice}$ and check
            \begin{itemize*}
                \item Freshness
                \item Compliance of names in ticket and authenticator
                \item Origin of message and network address in authenticator
            \end{itemize*}
        \end{enumerate*}
        \item Authentication of Servers (to client)
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item send $\{Timestamp+1\}_{SessionKey_{Alice/Server}}$ to Alice
            \item only by principal that knows $SessionKey_{Alice/Server}$
            \item only by server that can extract the session key from the ticket %$Ticket_{Alice/Server}=\{Alice,Server ,\dots , SessionKey_{Alice/Server}\}_{K_{TGS/Server}}$
        \end{itemize*}
    \end{enumerate*}

    Getting a Ticket for a Server
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Are valid for a pair âŸ¨client, serverâŸ©
        \item Are issued (but for TGS-Ticket itself) only by TGS
        \item Ticket request to TGS: $(server, TGS_{ticket}, authenticator)$
    \end{itemize*}

    TGS:
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Checks $Ticket_{Client/TGS}$ and $authenticator$
        \item Generates $SessionKey_{Client/Server}$ for client \& server
        \item Generates $Ticket_{Client/Server}$
        \item Encrypts both using shared session key $\{Server,$ $SessionKey_{Client/Server},Ticket_{Client/Server}\}_{SessionKey_{Client/TGS}}$
    \end{itemize*}
